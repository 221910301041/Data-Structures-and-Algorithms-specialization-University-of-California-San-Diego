## [Algorithms on strings, course 4](https://github.com/sudheernaidu53/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-specialization-University-of-California-San-Diego/tree/master/course%204%20-%20Algorithms%20on%20strings)

The solutions are little untidy and only few of the assignments are solved(enough to pass), not all.

#### running test cases provided in assignments
Coursera provides test cases under "tests" folder for some of the assignments. Code is not written for all assignments to read and check if your code passes all the test cases. But as an example, I wrote it for one assignment
Thank you for mentioning me the test files.
I added few lines of code at the end of the file (under "test if everything in tests folder passes" heading) https://github.com/sudheernaidu53/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-specialization-University-of-California-San-Diego/blob/master/course%202%20-%20Data%20Structures/week1_basic_data_structures/check_brackets_in_code/match%20brackets%20-%20good%2C%20pass.ipynb
`def test_function():`
That snippet of code reads test files, apply your function and compare your result and the actual result. It can be tweaked according to the need/assignment
